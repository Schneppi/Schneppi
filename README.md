ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Schneppi (or Sascha) â€” a passionate software developer with over 20 years of experience in designing and building robust, user-oriented systems.

Currently, Iâ€™m working at an Internet Service Provider, where I focus on the development and optimization of customer management solutions that are both reliable and intuitive to use. My work bridges technical precision with practical usability, ensuring that complex backend processes are seamlessly accessible to end users.

Over the course of my career, Iâ€™ve contributed to a wide range of projects â€” from small utilities to larger enterprise applications. I take pride in writing effective, maintainable code and continuously strive to expand my skill set while keeping up with current technologies and best practices.

When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy exploring ways to improve workflows, streamline processes, and learn from the open-source community.
